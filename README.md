This is my first coding project. A calculator!

All functions, except RNG, are basic and work as a normal Calculator would.

For RNG: enter a the value of which you want the random number to be between(all values start at zero), then click 'RNG'.
Example: If you want a random number between 0-100, enter 100 on the calculator, then click 'RNG'.
